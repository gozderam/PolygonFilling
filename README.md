# Polygon Filling
Application filling polygons with scanline algorithm (version with vertices sorting and Active Edges Table) including Phong lightning model.


## Algorithm
Filling polygons (grid of triangles) is programmed using scanline algorithm with vertices sorting and Active Edges Table (CPU implementation). Slef-implemented Phong lightning model is used. 

## Functionalities and user guide

You can adjust algorithm parameters using menu on the right panel. 
What is more, you can move triangles' vertices using mouse.
